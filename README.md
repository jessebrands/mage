# Mage

`mage` is my toy renderer application written using C++23 and Direct3D11.
It is provided as open source software under the GPL-3.0 license in the 
hopes that it might be useful for other people.

## Supported platforms

Since *mage* is a Direct3D11 application, the only supported platform
currently is Windows. The engine uses the Win32 API as its underlying
platform and will build anywhere Direct3D11 and Win32 are supported. The
application should also run quite well under Wine with DXVK.

## Building

Building *mage* is simple using CMake. More detailed instructions will be
added later but simply refer to the `CMakeLists.txt` file for now.

## License

The *mage* rendering application is distributed under the GPL-3.0 license.
